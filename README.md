My hobby project Code CAD program. 


## High Level Overview

## Dependencies 
I am a true believer that for a project to be 
maintainable in the long term we have to keep
as little dependancies as possible. This project
depends on the following dependancies 

- Flex
- Bison
- OpenCascade
- VTK (Soon to be removed as a dependent)

> :warning: **Note**: Not listing any of the dependancies dependances!
